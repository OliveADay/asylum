literally just those games where a bunch of cards visible for like 10 seconds then gotta get the matches with only 3 mistakes, otherwise positions re randomized and start over

asylum tieing in, little visual of hand reshuffling, hand snap then all cards reshuffle, 
- reshuffling has one random card pick another card to go to, then that card switches with another card until there have been an equal amount of switches as cards
you get let out of the asylum if you are able to do it
asylum keeper the disembodied hand, text coming from off screen being like "ok your free to go now"
intro being like "well you pissed in the carpet one too many times, so your family has sent you to this lovely facility, you will be released when you can PROVE your competence of memory" snaps and the cards come in
when you fail hand be like "ok well now you gotta retest, we can do this for however long you are able to guess this, I get payed hourly and frankly I prefer when I have nothing to do" other responces "wow you suck" one is like "sorry for not repeating the explainy bits I really don't wanna repeat myself even if you forget", marker for when its already said something saved so never repeats
